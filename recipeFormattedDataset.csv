Towels <INGR_END> <INSTR_START> WARNING: Always keep chicken away from any other kitchen items or foods. <NEXT_INSTR> If you cut chicken on a cutting board, wash and disinfect it and your knife directly after use. <NEXT_INSTR> Wash your hands as well after working with any meat. <NEXT_INSTR> Cross contamination can be a real threat. <NEXT_INSTR> Leave out all dried spices you'll use in your marinade listed below since you will need each of them again later at scewer construction time. <NEXT_INSTR> Wash and trim fat from your boneless chicken. <NEXT_INSTR> Cut in to 1"" cubes and place in your Ziplock bag. <NEXT_INSTR> Add 6 drops liquid smoke and massage chicken in bag very well. <NEXT_INSTR> Then add olive oil and all dried seasonings [except white pepper, lemon and dill] and massage again. <NEXT_INSTR> Place bag in fridge and marinate chicken for 2 + hours. <NEXT_INSTR> Massage chilled bag intermittently. <NEXT_INSTR> Wash your mushrooms and leave whole. <NEXT_INSTR> Also, chop your vegetables. <NEXT_INSTR> Peel, de-seed and shread the cucumbers like you would hash browns for your Tzatziki Sauce. <NEXT_INSTR> Once completed, place your shreadded cucumbers in a fine mesh strainer and sprinkle/mix them with sea salt to help sweat/drain any excess water from them for an hour. <NEXT_INSTR> Then place your cucumbers in cheese cloth or sturdy paper towels and squeeze to remove any additional fluids. <NEXT_INSTR> This step is very important since nobody enjoys a runny Tzatziki Sauce. <NEXT_INSTR> Now, make your Tzatziki Sauce by mixing 1/2 of your Sour Cream and 1/2 of your Greek Yogart together. <NEXT_INSTR> Then spoon into a fine mesh strainer for 1 hour to drain any excess fluid from them. <NEXT_INSTR> You can also alter your cream amounts to your personal preference. <NEXT_INSTR> If you're not fond of Greek Yogart, mix 75% Sour Cream to 25% Yogart or visa versa. <NEXT_INSTR> You can also use 100% Yogart or 100% Sour Cream. <NEXT_INSTR> After draining is complete, mix creams with your shreadded and fully drained cucumbers and other Tzatziki Sauce ingredients, [lemon juice, white pepper and dill] and refrigerate for at least one hour. <NEXT_INSTR> VEGETABLE SCEWER CONSTRUCTION: Feed all vegetables on to your metal scewers starting with your mushrooms, then Onions, Green Peppers, Red Peppers, Yellow Peppers and Eggplant. <NEXT_INSTR> Always start and finish with a mushroom as it will hold your vegetables on your scewers better. <NEXT_INSTR> Spray with Pam, all vegetables on all scewers and sprinkle the dried spices you used in your marinade over them. <NEXT_INSTR> Spray once again with Pam to seal those spices on your veggies. <NEXT_INSTR> CHICKEN SCEWER CONSTRUCTION: Feed your chicken on to your scewers and feed a small sliver of onion in between chicken pieces for even cooking and added flavor. <NEXT_INSTR> They also act as great temperature gauges. <NEXT_INSTR> When they turn black, move your chicken to a cooler spot on the grill. <NEXT_INSTR> Spray with Pam, all skewered chicken and sprinkle the dried spices you used in your marinade over the them. <NEXT_INSTR> Spray once again afterwards with Pam to seal those spices on your chicken. <NEXT_INSTR> GRILLING: Grill chicken and veggies until fully cooked but not burnt. <NEXT_INSTR> Keep veggies grilling on the cooler side of the grill and chicken at the hotter side. <NEXT_INSTR> Turn regularly for even grilling. <NEXT_INSTR> Your chicken shouldn't take that long to grill since they are only 1"" pieces. <NEXT_INSTR> About 12-15 minutes at 425. <NEXT_INSTR> FOR BREADS: Spray one side of your tortillas [or other bread] with Pam and sprinkle with dried marinade seasonings of your choosing. <NEXT_INSTR> Spray once more to seal on those spices. <NEXT_INSTR> Grill quickly until the tortillas rises like balloons and are slightly charred. <NEXT_INSTR> SERVING: Smear chilled Tzatziki Sauce inside your warm grilled tortillas or other breads and place chicken and vegetables on top. <NEXT_INSTR> AUTHORS NOTES: Other meat, seafood, vegetable, fruit & bread options are: Pork * Beef * Lamb * Shrimp & Scallops * Or, Eggplant * Squash * Corn On The Cob * Purple Onions * Zucchini * Red Potatoes * Assorted Mushrooms * Mango * Pineapple * Apples * Cherry Tomatoes * Or, Tandori * Paratha * Naan & Pita Breads. <NEXT_INSTR> Lastly, your Tzatziki Sauce will taste

"<RECIPE_START> <INPUT_START> artichokes <NEXT_INPUT> lemons <NEXT_INPUT> Olive oil <NEXT_INPUT> Salt <INPUT_END> <INGR_START> 4 whole globe artichokes <NEXT_INGR> 2 lemons, cut in half <NEXT_INGR> Olive oil for frying <NEXT_INGR> Salt and pepper <INGR_END> <INSTR_START> Prepare the artichokes by first peeling off the outer leaves that are tough and hard, beginning from the base, removing the leaves until you see they become more tender. Once you've done this, with a small, sharp knife, begin trimming the top points of the artichoke's remaining leaves, again working from the base up. When you reach halfway or so, cut the top half (or third, depending on how tender the artichokes are) of the artichoke completely off. Rub the artichokes all over with half a lemon. <NEXT_INSTR> Now trim the stem; chop the bottom off, leaving about 2 to 3 inches of stem and then trim it, peeling away the outer layer of the stem and the bottom of the artichoke so you have just the tender inner part of the stem attached. Place the artichokes in a bowl with the juice of 1 lemon until they are ready for frying. Drain completely and pat dry with kitchen paper before frying. <NEXT_INSTR> Heat about 3 inches of olive oil in a saucepan over low-medium heat and fry the artichokes gently (if you have a candy thermometer, this should be about 300° F or 150° C) for about 10 minutes, prodding them with a fork every now and then, letting them roll around to cook thoroughly. <NEXT_INSTR> Remove and drain the artichokes on paper towels. When cool enough to handle (you can also pop them into the freezer for a couple minutes to do this quickly), help open up the artichoke carefully by teasing some of the leaves out and flattening the artichoke a little. <NEXT_INSTR> Turning the heat up higher (this time about 350°F or 180°C), deep fry the artichokes, head down (tongs are handy for this) for a couple of minutes or until crisp and a deep, deep golden brown. Drain on paper towels then serve while still hot, sprinkled with sea salt and some pepper. <INSTR_END> <TITLE_START> Carciofi Alla Giudia – Roman Jewish-Style Artichokes <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END>"

Stir in the beans and then the liquid. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to simmer until the beans are softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5-7 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat. Smash the beans and the chorizo together in a coarse mash, adding additional liquid if necessary a tablespoon at a time so the mixture is not dry.

Set the oven to 250 degrees. <NEXT_INSTR> When the oven indicates 250 degrees has been reached, take the bread out and cut 4 slices roughly 2 - 2 1/2"" thick each. Scoop a section of the bread out of the middle of each piece so there is about a 1""hole in the middle of each slice. <NEXT_INSTR> Heat the olive oil (or bacon fat or mix of both) in a 12 inch cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic, fennel seed, peppers and cherry tomatoes. Add, salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring frequently, until cherry tomatoes collapse. Remove to a bowl for serving. <NEXT_INSTR> Add butter to the same skillet and decrease heat slightly. Once the butter is foaming, add the slices of french bread cut side down. Carefully crack each egg over the hole in each slice of the french bread so that the yolk runs into the hole. The white of the egg will spill over. No worries. After about 30 seconds to one minute, carefully flip each slice over with a broad spatula. Cook about another 1 to 2 minutes (depending how you like your eggs) and remove to individual plates for serving. Top each serving with tomato/pepper mixture and sprinkle with parsely. Serve. Some bacon wouldn't hurt. <INSTR_END> <TITLE_START> Moonstruck Eggs In A Basket <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END>"

Stir until a very soft dough forms. Knead in last cup of flour a bit at a time until you have a soft dough that's not terribly sticky. Cover with a dish towel (or plastic wrap if going in fridge overnight) and leave in a warm place until double its size. <NEXT_INSTR> In the meantime make the filling by stirring all filling ingredients together. If it's too stiff you can warm a bit, but it should not be a liquid. <NEXT_INSTR> Roll out risen dough into a rectangle about the size and shape of a cookie sheet, around 1/4-12 inch thick.

whisk to combine; set aside. <NEXT_INSTR> In the bowl of an electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, beat the butter at medium speed until cream, about 30 seconds. <NEXT_INSTR> Gradually add in sugar; beat at high speed until well blended and light, about 3 minutes. <NEXT_INSTR> Scrape down sides of bowl as needed; decrease speed to medium and add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and mixing until blended. <NEXT_INSTR> Beat in the lemon zest and lemon juice until blended. <NEXT_INSTR> Decrease speed to low and add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating it with the milk in two additions, and mixing just until blended. <NEXT_INSTR> Scraped batter into prepared pans, dividing it evenly, and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula. <NEXT_INSTR> Bake cakes for 22-25 minutes, until they are golden brown around the edges and a pick comes out clean. <NEXT_INSTR> Cool cakes in pans on wire racks for 15 minutes; invert cakes onto the wire racks and let cool completely. <NEXT_INSTR> The filling: in a bowl of an electric mixer, using the whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream at high speed until firm peaks form; transfer the whipped cream to a smaller bowl, cover, and refrigerate. <NEXT_INSTR> In the same mixer bowl (no need to wash it), using the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until very creamy, about 2 minutes. <NEXT_INSTR> On low speed, beat in the vanilla extract. <NEXT_INSTR> Add the lemon curd and beat at medium speed until well blended and smooth, about 1 minute. <NEXT_INSTR> Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and, using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the whipped cream until almost completely blended. <NEXT_INSTR> Cover the bowl and refrigerate while you make the syrup and buttercream. <NEXT_INSTR> The syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the water, lemon juice, and sugar; bring to a boil over med-high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar; remove the pan from the heat and set aside at room temperature. <NEXT_INSTR> The buttercream: in a bowl of an electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, beat the butter at medium speed until cream and light, about 2 minutes. <NEXT_INSTR> At medium speed, gradually add the lemon curd, a large spoonful at a time, then add the salt and beat at med-high speed until creamy and light, about 1 1/2 minutes; set aside at room temperature while you assemble the cake. <NEXT_INSTR> Assemble cake: using a long serrated knife, trim off the domed tops of the cakes so that they are even; cut each cake horizontally into 2 layers; reserve one of the flat bottom layers for the top of the cake. <NEXT_INSTR> Place another layer cut side up on a cardboard cake round or flat serving plate; generously brush with some of the lemon syrup. <NEXT_INSTR> Spoon a scant cup of the filling onto the cake and, using a small offset spatula, spread it into an even layer, leaving a 1/2 inch border around the edge of the cake. <NEXT_INSTR> Top with another cake layer and brush it with more syrup; top with another scant cup of filling. <NEXT_INSTR> Repeat with another layer, more syrup, and remaining filling. <NEXT_INSTR> Brush the cut side of the reserved cake layer with remaining syrup; place the layer cut side down on top of the cake. <NEXT_INSTR> Frost the sides and top of the cake with the buttercream. <NEXT_INSTR> Serve the cake at room temperature;

Make a well in the center for the water. <NEXT_INSTR> Pour in the water and mix. I find using one hand to steady the bowl and the other to mix the dough is sufficient. Keep adding water a little bit at a time if necessary until the dough has formed, is uniform, and slightly sticky. Don't worry about overworking. <NEXT_INSTR> Shape the dough roughly into a rounded disk and lay to ""sleep"" in the same mixing bowl you just used. Dampen a cloth or paper towel and drape over the dough lightly to prevent drying. <NEXT_INSTR> Let the dough ""sleep"" for about 20-30 minutes. <NEXT_INSTR> While the dough is sleeping, rinse the green onions and chop them, discarding the root ends. Set aside. It will seem like you have a lot. You should! <NEXT_INSTR> Generously flour a work surface. <NEXT_INSTR> Knead the dough a few times and check the consistency. It should be smooth and dry to the touch, but soft and pliable. If it is too wet and sticky, it will incorporate some of the flour from your work surface as you knead it. You may need to add more flour, but go slow. If it is too dry, it will be hard to knead, get crackly on the outside, and be slow to spring back. In that case, add a few drops of water. <NEXT_INSTR> Once the consistency feels right, shape the dough into a disk shape and begin to roll it out with a rolling pin (I think the plain old wooden broom handle types are the easiest for this). Rotate the dough as you roll. Sometimes it may seem as though you aren't getting anywhere because the dough will keep springing back, but after a certain point it will start to behave and keep its shape. <NEXT_INSTR> Roll the dough as thinly and evenly as you can. It should be a very large and thin circle. Patch the holes with torn off pieces from the edge. <NEXT_INSTR> Pour the oil onto the dough's surface. Use the back of a spoon to smooth it out evenly, taking care not to tear the dough. Make sure the edges are covered too. <NEXT_INSTR> Generously sprinkle the chopped green onions all over the dough. Again, get all the way out to the edge. <NEXT_INSTR> Generously salt and season the pancake. Most often heard complaint over three generations has been, ""It's not salty enough!"" <NEXT_INSTR> Once the dough has been topped with the oil, green onions, and salt, start at the bottom edge of the dough and begin to roll it up all the way to the top so it looks like a long tube <NEXT_INSTR> You may need to add some more flour to your work surface at this point. Next, press down lightly on each end to seal, and coil the roll around itself so it looks like a snail, tucking the ends under and pressing down lightly <NEXT_INSTR> With the rolling pin, gently roll out the pancake a bit again, flattening it to the desired thickness. I like mine about 1/2-3/4 inch think. Remember, a thicker pancake equals longer cooking time. <NEXT_INSTR> Heat a little oil in a heavy bottomed pan, just to cover it. I prefer a cast iron skillet. Cook the pancake on medium-low heat, about ten minutes each side. <NEXT_INSTR> Cut into wedges and serve. <INSTR_END> <TITLE_START> Green Onion Pancakes <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END>"

Set a pan containing a quart of water on the stove to heat. <NEXT_INSTR> Pour milk and cream into a stainless steel saucepan. Add ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, and the chile de arbol. Stir, then set over medium heat. Bring to a scald, then remove from heat and put a lid on the pot. Let spices steep for 30 minutes. <NEXT_INSTR> Whisk egg yolks together in a mixing bowl. Add the salt to the sugar, and add them to the yolks in a slow, steady stream, whisking continuously. <NEXT_INSTR> Break milk chocolate into pieces and place in a separate mixing bowl. Set a strainer over the bowl. Strain the milk and cream mixture into this bowl and let sit for one minute for the chocolate to melt. Discard spices. Stir mixture with a spatula to completely incorporate melted chocolate. <NEXT_INSTR> Temper chocolate mixture into the eggs and sugar by pouring in a slow, steady stream, and whisking all the while. <NEXT_INSTR> Divide among 4 ramekins. Break the piece of cayenne-chocolate into 4 sections. Drop one into each of the ramekins. This is going to put a little surprise down in the middle of your custards. <NEXT_INSTR> Set the ramekins on a baking sheet with 4 sides. Set the baking sheet in the oven. Pour the hot water into a large measuring cup or pitcher. Use that to pour hot water into the baking sheet so that it comes almost to the lip. Set a second baking sheet on top of the ramekins. This will prevent the custard from forming a skin on the surface. <NEXT_INSTR> Bake custards for 35-40 minutes. When done, they should still be a bit jiggly. I use a canning jar lifter to remove the custards from the oven. Don't try to lift the baking sheet full of hot water out of the oven until the water has cooled. Leave the door ajar, and the water should be cool enough to safely handle within a half hour or so. <NEXT_INSTR> Cool before serving, but it need not be refrigerator-cold. The custard will have more flavor if it's closer to room temperature. Top with a splosh of whipped cream. <INSTR_END> <TITLE_START> Spice Of Life Pots De Crème <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END>"

(Do this no more than 30 minutes before you plan to start mixing the batter.) <NEXT_INSTR> Using a fork, beat the 4 egg yolks together with the vanilla extract in a glass liquid measure (its pouring spout is handy here) or a small bowl. <NEXT_INSTR> If using decorative paper mini-loaf pans, line them completely with foil. Otherwise, use parchment to line the long sides and bottoms of your pans, to create a sling. Generously butter the ends and corners of the loaf pans. <NEXT_INSTR> Sift the flour with the nutmeg and baking powder. <NEXT_INSTR> Beat the butter in the mixing bowl on medium high for 3 minutes, scraping down once, halfway through. It should be light in color and starting to look a bit fluffy. Gradually add the sugar while beating on medium, scraping down the sides after you've added about half. Once all of the sugar is incorporated, beat on medium high for 3 minutes. <NEXT_INSTR> Very slowly add the beaten yolks in a stream while beating at medium speed. Continue to beat for another 2 minutes, scraping down after 1 minute. <NEXT_INSTR> Beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar just until firm peaks hold their shape when the beaters are lifted out. (Do not let the beaten whites get too stiff, as they will be dry and that will make the cake drier as a consequence.) <NEXT_INSTR> Stir the fruit and their soaking liquid into the batter. Fold the dry ingredients, a third at a time, into the batter, adding the pecans with the final third. <NEXT_INSTR> Take a big dollop (no more than 1/5th by volume) of the egg whites and stir them into the batter. Gently fold the remaining egg whites into the batter. <NEXT_INSTR> Pour the batter into the prepared mini-loaves. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick stuck in the center is clean when removed. <NEXT_INSTR> Let the loaves cool for about five minutes in the pans. Gently remove them from the foil and let them cool on a wire rack for at least an hour. <NEXT_INSTR> To wrap for storage, measure and cut four rectangles of cheesecloth large enough to wrap each loaf as if it were a gift to be wrapped with paper. Cut four somewhat larger rectangles of foil. In a wide, shallow bowl, put two pieces of cloth. Moisten them thoroughly with 2 tablespoons of whiskey. Center one of the soaked pieces of cloth onto one of the pieces of cut foil. Place one loaf on the cloth and wrap it, tucking the ends under to secure. Wrap tightly with the foil. Do the same thing for each of the four loaves. Wrap each loaf tightly with plastic wrap / cling film. Put the four loaves into a larger plastic bag and store in a cool place until ready to give. The cakes will continue to taste great, if these steps are followed, for at least two months. <NEXT_INSTR> Also, please note that this slices best when cool. The original recipe recommends storing it in the fridge for a few hours before serving. The slices will soon warm up. <NEXT_INSTR> Enjoy! ;o) <NEXT_INSTR> You can double this to bake in a large tube pan for 3 hours, or two large loaves, baked for an hour and a half to two hours, or until a toothpick tests clean. <INSTR_END> <TITLE_START> Kentucky Whiskey Cake -- An Updated Version For Making Mini-Loaves <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END>"

I prefer it to regular milk since I was lactose intolerant until I was a teenager. Since soymilk has protein, I think it adds body to the brownie since this recipe doesn't use eggs. <NEXT_INSTR> ** Microwave times may vary according to your own microwave. Microwave your brownie in increments at first try to make sure you don't overcook/undercook your brownie. <NEXT_INSTR> --- <NEXT_INSTR> The less you microwave it, the gooier the brownie. You can even eat the batter itself! Don't worry; the batter has no eggs! <NEXT_INSTR> If you add more baking powder, the fluffier the brownie is. The less baking powder, it will rise less. I haven't tried this, but some mug brownie recipes opt out the baking powder to make their brownie gooier. You can try experimenting to your preferences especially if you don't have/want to buy baking powder. (Personally, I keep the baking powder and just microwave my brownie for less time if I want a gooey brownie.) <INSTR_END> <TITLE_START> Easy Microwave Mug Brownie (With Nesquik!)  <TITLE_END> <RECIPE_END>"
